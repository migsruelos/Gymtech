            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h3>Welcome to the beginner friendly, fundamentals based fitness website! At Gymtech, we value<br>
                giving beginners correct (and useful!) fitness information that will help them start or continue<br>
                their journey in the safest, healthiest, and time efficient way possible.<br><br>
                Gymtech was developed by Joaquin Aldaba, a fitness enthusiast and a multimedia arts student.<br>
                As an avid gymrat, he wishes that there were more beginner friendly fitness websites when he<br>
                started his fitness journey, hence the creation of Gymtech. Joaquin believes that every gym goer<br>
                has the right to access quality, correct, and effective information, minus the “gymtimidation”,or<br>
                gym intimidation! Gymtech provides users with quality workout information that they can do in<br>
                their own time, at their own pace, but remember, it must also be challenging enough to make<br>
                sufficient progress!<br><br>
                In this website, you will find easy to understand fundamental fitness information which you can<br>
                apply to your daily life, without sacrificing the things that are important to you. We hope you<br>
                enjoy your visit here!</h3>
